# FaceTrack

I was just bored and made this project for fun (actually nothing).

## Purpose

FaceTrack is a simple Python application that uses OpenCV to detect and track faces from your webcam. It assigns random info and stats to each detected face, just for entertainment.

## Features

- Real-time face detection and tracking
- Random "info" and stats for each face
- Displays FPS and face labels
- Fullscreen display

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)

## Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

Press `q` to quit.

## Disclaimer

This project was just nothing to take seriously, really
